### Making cmmtr comments legible

This Add-on will make cmmtr comments easier to read.
If you have ever come across a website that uses cmmtr comments, you'll find the text is small, dark, and all scrunched up, making it difficult to read. This Add-on fixes that problem with a little added styling.
